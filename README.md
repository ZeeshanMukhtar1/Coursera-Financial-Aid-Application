# ðŸš€ About this Repository

<p>Welcome to our financial aid application repository, designed to help students apply for financial aid and scholarships on various online learning platforms. My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zeeshanmukhtar1/">Zeeshan Mukhtar</a> and I am the creator of this repository. As someone who has completed a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology in Pakistan, I understand the financial barriers that many students face when it comes to accessing education. That's why I've created this repository to provide guidance and resources to other students who may be in similar situations. We believe that education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation.</p>

<p>This repository includes a financial aid application template that can be used as a reference to apply for financial aid on Coursera. The template includes guidelines on what to write in each section of the application, such as why you are applying for financial aid and how the course will help you achieve your career goals.</p>

<p>If you have any feedback, suggestions, or contributions to improve this repository for students, please feel free to reach out to us. Let's work together to make education accessible to all.</p>
