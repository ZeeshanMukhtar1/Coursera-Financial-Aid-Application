    <summary>If you answered no, please help us understand why.</summary>
    <p>I believe that education should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation. However, in many developing countries, the average rate of income is low, and people struggle to meet their basic needs, such as food, shelter, and healthcare. Therefore, paying for educational courses is often not feasible.</p>
     <p>I think it is essential to have free courses and educational resources available to those who cannot afford to pay for them. It would provide them with the opportunity to learn new skills, improve their lives, and contribute to the development of their communities. Access to education is a fundamental right, and we need to ensure that everyone has access to it, irrespective of their financial situation.</p>
